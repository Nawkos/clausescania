## Overview

This document provides complete transparency into all AI prompts used during the development of ClauseScan AI, as required by the SPOC IA assignment.

**Total Prompts:** 47  
**Primary Tool:** Lovable.dev (AI-powered web development platform)  
**Supporting Tools:** ChatGPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GitHub Copilot  
**Development Duration:** 7 days

---

## Prompt Engineering Strategy

### Our Approach
We followed an **iterative refinement strategy** rather than trying to build everything in one prompt:

1. **Start Simple:** Basic UI and structure first
2. **Add Functionality:** Incrementally add features
3. **Refine UX:** Polish design and user experience
4. **Optimize:** Performance and error handling
5. **Document:** Final documentation and polish

### Prompt Best Practices We Learned

✅ **DO:**
- Break large features into small, specific prompts
- Include exact file names and locations
- Specify design tokens and color schemes
- Reference existing components
- Test before moving to next prompt

❌ **DON'T:**
- Ask for "build entire app" in one prompt
- Use vague terms like "make it better"
- Change multiple unrelated things at once
- Skip testing between prompts

---

## AI Tools Used

- Success: Green (#10b981) for safe contracts  
- Warning: Orange (#f59e0b) for caution
- Danger: Red (#ef4444) for risks

Add semantic tokens:
- --safe: hsl(142, 71%, 45%)
- --caution: hsl(38, 92%, 50%)

1. Severity (critical/moderate/attention)
2. Clause text
3. Risk explanation
4. Recommendation

Also provide an overall risk score from 0-100 where:
- 0-40: Dangerous
- 41-70: Caution

## Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **Iterative Development**
   - Small, focused prompts > one giant prompt
   - Test after each prompt before continuing
   - Easier to debug and refine

2. **Specific Instructions**
   - "Add a button" → ❌ Too vague
   - "Add a blue primary button labeled 'Analyze' that calls handleAnalyze() function" → ✅ Clear

3. **Reference Existing Code**
   - "Use the same style as FileUpload component"
   - "Follow pattern from Analysis page"
   - Ensures consistency

4. **Design System First**
   - Set up colors/tokens early
   - Reuse throughout project
   - Consistent look and feel

### What We'd Do Differently

1. **Plan Database Schema Earlier**
   - We didn't need Supabase tables for this project
   - But planning data structure upfront helps

2. **Write Tests**
   - Didn't write unit tests (time constraints)
   - Would add in production version

3. **More User Testing**
   - Tested ourselves but not with real users
   - Could have caught UX issues earlier

4. **Version Control**
   - Lovable has built-in versioning
   - Should have used Git branches too

   ```

2. **Specify design system usage**
   ```
   ✅ "Use --primary token from index.css"
   ❌ "Use blue color"
   ```

3. **Reference shadcn components**

   ❌ "Create a card"
   ```

4. **Include expected behavior**
   ```
   ✅ "Button should disable during upload and show spinner"
   ❌ "Add loading state"
   ```

5. **Ask for specific libraries**
   ```
   ✅ "Use Framer Motion for animations"
   ❌ "Add animations"
   ```
