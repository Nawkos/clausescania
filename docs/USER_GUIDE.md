## 3. Understanding Your Results

### The Risk Score

After analysis, you'll see a large circular score (0-100) with a color:

#### 🟢 GREEN (71-100): SAFE CONTRACT
**Meaning:** This is a well-balanced contract with strong protections.

**Action:** 
- Generally safe to sign
- Still review all clauses carefully
- Consider minor improvements suggested

**Example:** Score 88/100
"This contract has good terms and protections. Only minor attention points identified."

---

#### 🟠 ORANGE (41-70): CAUTION
**Meaning:** This contract has some concerns that should be addressed.

**Action:**
- Review moderate concerns carefully
- Negotiate problematic clauses
- Consult a lawyer if uncertain
- Don't sign without addressing issues

**Example:** Score 65/100
"This contract needs some negotiation. Several clauses favor one party heavily."

---

#### 🔴 RED (0-40): DANGER
**Meaning:** This contract contains critical issues and major risks.

**Action:**
- DO NOT SIGN without significant changes
- Multiple critical clauses must be renegotiated
- Strongly recommend legal consultation
- Consider finding an alternative contract

**Example:** Score 34/100
"This contract is extremely risky. Contains multiple deal-breaker clauses."

---

### Alert Categories

ClauseScan identifies three types of alerts:

#### 🔴 CRITICAL ALERTS
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Deal-breakers that could cost you significantly

**Examples:**
- Complete loss of intellectual property rights
- Excessive penalties without limits
- Unfair termination clauses
- Extremely one-sided liability
- Illegal non-compete clauses

**What to do:** These MUST be negotiated or removed before signing.

---

#### 🟠 MODERATE ALERTS
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Significant concerns that should be addressed

**Examples:**
- Unbalanced payment terms
- Long notice periods
- Automatic renewal without warning
- Broad confidentiality requirements
- Missing mutual protections

**What to do:** Strongly advise negotiating these points.

---

#### 🟡 ATTENTION POINTS
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Minor issues or unclear language

**Examples:**
- Ambiguous wording
- Missing minor clauses

- Lack of specificity

**What to do:** Good to clarify, but not critical.

---

### Reading Alert Details

Each alert card shows:

**1. Alert Header**

### Market Comparison

The results page includes industry benchmarking:

**Your Score vs. Market**
```

Industry Average:  72/100 🟢
Best Score Seen:   94/100 🟢
```

**Percentile Ranking**
> ⚠️ This contract is riskier than 89% of similar contracts

**What this means:**
- **Percentile < 50%:** Better than most contracts (good!)
- **Percentile 50-70%:** Average contract
- **Percentile > 70%:** Worse than most contracts (caution!)

---

### Missing Clauses

The analysis also identifies important protections NOT included in your contract:

**Example:**
```
💡 MISSING CLAUSES

The following important clauses were not found:
• Force Majeure Protection
• Mutual Confidentiality
• Dispute Resolution Process

Why this matters: These clauses protect both parties 
in unforeseen circumstances and clarify expectations.

---

### Results Questions

**Q: Why is my score so low?**  
A: Low scores indicate multiple risky clauses. Review each alert carefully - they're real concerns.

**Q: Can the same contract get different scores?**  
A: Scores should be very consistent. Small variations (±3 points) are possible due to AI randomness.

**Q: What if I disagree with an alert?**  
A: Our AI is highly accurate but not perfect. Use your judgment and consult a lawyer if unsure.

**Q: Why are some clauses not flagged?**  
A: We focus on common legal risks. Unusual or context-specific issues might not be detected.

A: Yes! Upload the same contract again to re-analyze, or consult a legal professional.

---

### Action Questions

**Q: Should I sign a contract with a red score?**  
A: No! Red scores (0-40) indicate critical issues. Negotiate changes before signing.

**Q: Is an orange score acceptable?**  
A: Orange scores (41-70) mean "proceed with caution." Address moderate concerns through negotiation.

**Q: Can ClauseScan edit my contract?**  
A: Not currently. We provide recommendations, but you or your lawyer must make the actual changes.

**Q: Will my lawyer accept this analysis?**  
A: Our reports are informational tools. Lawyers often appreciate having issues pre-identified, saving time and money.

**Q: What if the other party refuses changes?**  
A: You have options:
- Negotiate compromise solutions
- Accept the risk knowingly
- Seek alternative contracts
- Walk away from the deal
