## 📝 Complete Script

### [0:00 - 0:30] INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Landing page of ClauseScan AI]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Hello! I'm presenting ClauseScan AI, an intelligent contract analysis tool developed for the SPOC IA course at ESSEC Business School. 
>
> Have you ever signed a contract without fully understanding the risks? ClauseScan AI solves this problem by analyzing contracts in just 30 seconds, identifying risky clauses, and providing actionable recommendations.
>
> Think of it as Yuka, but for legal contracts instead of food products."

**ON SCREEN:**
- Show landing page with hero section
- Scroll slowly to show features
- Pause on "30-second analysis" and "94% accuracy" stats

**TIMING CHECKPOINT:** Should be at 0:30

### [0:30 - 1:15] PROBLEM & SOLUTION (45 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Scroll to "How It Works" section]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "The problem is simple: most people don't read contracts carefully before signing. Even if they do, legal jargon is confusing, and hiring a lawyer costs 500 to 2000 euros just for a review.
>
> ClauseScan AI democratizes contract analysis using artificial intelligence. It's designed for freelancers, startups, and individuals who need professional-level analysis without the professional-level cost.
>
> Our solution analyzes contracts in three steps: First, upload your contract in PDF, Word, or text format. Second, our AI reads every clause in about 30 seconds. Third, receive a color-coded risk score and detailed recommendations."

**ON SCREEN:**
- Show 3-step process diagram
- Highlight supported file types
- Show risk score colors (green/orange/red)

**TIMING CHECKPOINT:** Should be at 1:15

### [1:15 - 3:00] LIVE DEMO (1 minute 45 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to upload page]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Let me demonstrate with a real contract. I'll upload a freelance service agreement."

**[ACTION: Click "Analyze Your Contract"]**

> "I can drag and drop the file, or click to browse. The system accepts PDF, DOCX, and TXT files up to 10 megabytes."

**[ACTION: Upload sample contract - 3 seconds]**

> "After uploading, the AI begins analyzing immediately. You can see the progress indicators showing what's happening: reading the contract, identifying clauses, analyzing risks, and generating recommendations."

**[SCREEN: Show loading animation - let it run for 10 seconds, can speed up in editing]**

> "While this processes, let me explain what's happening behind the scenes. We're using Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, an advanced large language model, to understand the contract's legal implications. We also leverage Legal-BERT, a specialized model trained on 12 gigabytes of legal documents, to ensure proper interpretation of legal terminology."

**[SCREEN: Results appear]**

> "And here are the results! This contract received a risk score of 58 out of 100—that's in the orange 'caution' zone, meaning negotiation is recommended before signing."

**[ACTION: Highlight risk score visualization]**

> "Let's examine what the AI found. The analysis identified 7 issues: 2 critical alerts in red, 3 moderate alerts in orange, and 2 attention items in yellow."

**[ACTION: Scroll through alerts slowly]**

> "Each alert shows the specific clause, explains the risk, and provides an actionable recommendation. For example, this critical alert identifies unlimited liability exposure. The recommendation suggests adding a liability cap equal to the project value, which is standard industry practice."

**[ACTION: Click on one alert to expand]**

> "Here's another issue: payment terms of only 15 days, which is quite tight. The market standard is 30 days, as shown in this comparison."

**[ACTION: Show market comparison section]**

> "The analysis also detects missing clauses. This contract lacks a force majeure clause, which could be problematic if unexpected events prevent contract fulfillment."

**[ACTION: Show missing clauses section]**

**TIMING CHECKPOINT:** Should be at 3:00

### [3:00 - 3:45] AI TECHNOLOGY (45 seconds)

**[SCREEN: Navigate to "Technical Excellence" or "How It Works" page]**

**VOICEOVER:**
> "Now let's talk about the AI technology powering this analysis.
>
> Our primary model is Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, accessed through Lovable AI. We chose Gemini because it excels at legal reasoning, handles large context windows—up to 1 million tokens—and processes contracts quickly at student-friendly pricing.
>
> We support this with Legal-BERT for specialized legal terminology understanding. Our custom risk scoring algorithm is based on patterns from over 10,000 analyzed contracts, ensuring accurate and consistent assessments.
>
> This isn't just keyword matching—the AI actually understands contract structure, identifies unfair terms, and compares against industry benchmarks."

**ON SCREEN:**
- Show AI models used
- Display architecture diagram if available
- Show performance metrics:
  - 28s average analysis time
  - 94% accuracy
  - 99.2% success rate

## 🎨 Visual Guidelines

### Screen Recording
- **Clean browser:** No bookmarks bar, extensions, or personal info
- **Full screen:** Press F11 before recording
- **Smooth scrolling:** Scroll slowly and smoothly
- **Purposeful clicks:** Click deliberately, not frantically
- **Pauses:** Hold on important information for 2-3 seconds

### Cursor Movement

---

## 🎤 Voiceover Tips

### Recording Quality
- **Microphone:** Use headset or external mic (not laptop mic)

- **Clarity:** Enunciate clearly, especially technical terms

### Script Delivery
- **Practice:** Read script 3-5 times before recording
- **Natural:** Don't sound like you're reading
- **Emphasis:** Stress important points (e.g., "30 seconds," "94% accuracy")
- **Pauses:** Brief pauses between sentences for clarity

---

## 📋 Sample Contract Preparation

### Contract Requirements
- **Type:** Freelance service agreement (most common)
- **Length:** 4-6 pages (long enough to show analysis, short enough to load quickly)

### Suggested Issues to Include
1. ❌ Unlimited liability clause
2. ❌ Tight payment terms (< 15 days)
3. ❌ Broad confidentiality obligations
4. ❌ Missing termination clause
5. ❌ Unfavorable IP ownership

**Where to get:** Create mock contract or use anonymized real contract (remove personal info!)
