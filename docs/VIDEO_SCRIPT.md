## SECTION 1: HOOK & PROBLEM (0:00-0:30)

**Screen:** Title slide "ClauseScan AI" + statistic overlay  

**Script:**
"77% of freelancers regret signing their first contract - hidden clauses, excessive penalties, lost rights. I'm [YOUR NAME] from Groupe 20, and today I'm presenting ClauseScan AI - the Yuka for contracts.

Most people don't have time or legal expertise to review contracts properly. That's what we're solving."

**Note:** Keep energy high, problem clear in 30 seconds.

## SECTION 2: SOLUTION & DEMO (0:30-3:30)

### Part A: Interface Introduction (0:30-1:00)

**Screen:** Homepage https://clausescania.lovable.app  

**Script:**
"ClauseScan AI analyzes any contract in 30 seconds. It works like Yuka - the food scanning app - but for legal clauses.

You get an instant risk score from 0 to 100:
- Green: safe to sign
- Orange: negotiate first  
- Red: danger, don't sign

Let me show you with a real freelance contract."

### Part B: Upload & Analysis (1:00-2:00)

**Screen:** Upload contract_red_freelance.txt, show loading  

**Script:**
"I'm uploading this freelance contract. [DRAG FILE]

While the AI analyzes, here's what happens behind the scenes:
- Text extraction from the document
- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash reads every clause
- Comparison against contract risk patterns
- Generation of specific recommendations

Takes about 30 seconds - much faster than reading the full contract yourself."

### Part C: Results Walkthrough (2:00-3:30)

**Screen:** Results page showing red score  

**Script:**
"Results are in. [REVEAL SCORE]

Score: 34 out of 100 - RED - this is a dangerous contract.

[POINT TO ALERTS]
The AI detected 8 alerts: 3 critical, 5 moderate.

[CLICK first critical alert]
Most critical issue: Intellectual Property Rights, Clause 12.3.

Problem: 'All work product exclusively belongs to client' - you lose ALL rights to your work. Can't even use it in your portfolio.

Recommendation: 'Negotiate for a license model with attribution rights' - specific, actionable advice.

[SCROLL to show other alerts briefly]
Seven more issues like this: payment delays, excessive penalties, unfair termination clauses."

## SECTION 3: VALUE PROPOSITION (3:30-4:30)

**Screen:** Use cases slides or About page  

**Script:**
"Who is this for?

Freelancers reviewing client contracts - avoid IP traps and unfair terms.
Startups analyzing SaaS agreements - catch auto-renewal and liability issues.  
Students checking internship contracts - ensure fair compensation and hours.

The value? Traditional legal consultation: €500 to €2,000 per contract.
ClauseScan AI: instant analysis, free for basic use.

For widespread adoption, imagine: every freelancer, every startup scanning contracts before signing. Millions of euros in avoided penalties and disputes."
