## 📝 FULL SCRIPT (Read this word-for-word)

### 🎬 SECTION 1: HOOK & PROBLEM (0:00-0:30)

**[SCREEN: Black screen with text appearing]**

**TEXT ON SCREEN:**
> "77% of freelancers regret signing their first contract"
> "Hidden clauses. Excessive penalties. Lost rights."

**[YOU APPEAR on camera OR continue with screen]**

**YOU SAY:**
```
Hi, I'm [YOUR NAME], and today I'm presenting ClauseScan AI - 
the Yuka for contracts.

Have you ever signed a contract without fully understanding it? 
You're not alone. Most people don't have the time or legal expertise 
to review contracts properly.

That's the problem we're solving.
```

**[TRANSITION: Fade to application homepage]**

---

### 🎬 SECTION 2: SOLUTION INTRO (0:30-1:00)

**[SCREEN: ClauseScan AI homepage]**

**YOU SAY:**
```
ClauseScan AI analyzes any contract in just 30 seconds.

It works like Yuka - the food scanning app - but instead of 
ingredients, we scan legal clauses.

You get an instant risk score from 0 to 100:
- Green means safe
- Orange means negotiate
- Red means danger - don't sign

Let me show you how it works with a real example.
```

**[POINT to the upload zone on screen]**

---

### 🎬 SECTION 3: LIVE DEMO - PART 1 (1:00-2:00)

**[SCREEN: Upload a contract file]**

**YOU SAY:**
```
I have a freelance contract here that I need to review.

[DRAG AND DROP or CLICK to upload contract_red_freelance.txt]

The file uploads instantly...

And now our AI is analyzing it.
```

**[SCREEN: Show loading progress]**

**[WHILE LOADING, EXPLAIN - speak over the loading screen]:**
```
Behind the scenes, our system is:
- First, extracting text from the document
- Then, our AI - Google Gemini 2.5 Flash - reads every clause
- It's comparing against 10,000 risk patterns in our database
- And generating specific recommendations

This takes about 30 seconds - much faster than reading 
the entire contract yourself.
```

**[SCREEN: Results appear]**

---

### 🎬 SECTION 4: LIVE DEMO - PART 2 (2:00-3:00)

**[SCREEN: Results page showing red score]**

**YOU SAY:**
```
And here are the results.

[POINT TO SCORE]
Score: 34 out of 100 - RED - This is a dangerous contract.

[POINT TO ALERT SUMMARY]
Our AI detected 8 alerts:
- 3 critical issues
- 5 moderate concerns

Let's look at the most critical one.

[CLICK on first critical alert to expand]
```

**[SCREEN: Alert details expanded]**

**YOU SAY:**
```
Alert: Intellectual Property Rights - Clause 12.3

The problem: "All work product exclusively belongs to the client"

This means you lose ALL rights to your work. You can't even 
use it in your portfolio or reuse code you created.

[POINT TO RECOMMENDATION]
Our AI suggests: "Negotiate for a license model with attribution rights"

This is specific, actionable advice - not just a warning.

[SCROLL down to show other alerts briefly]

There are 7 more issues like this - payment delays, 
excessive penalties, unfair termination...
```

---

### 🎬 SECTION 5: BENCHMARK & FEATURES (3:00-3:30)

**[SCREEN: Market comparison section]**

**YOU SAY:**
```
ClauseScan also shows you how your contract compares to others.

[POINT TO BENCHMARK]
This contract: 34/100
Industry average: 72/100

That means this contract is riskier than 89% of similar contracts.

[SCROLL to show document viewer OR export button]

You can view the original document with risky clauses highlighted,
and export a professional PDF report to share with a lawyer.
```

**[OPTIONAL: Quickly show document viewer if time permits]**

---

### 🎬 SECTION 6: USE CASES & VALUE (3:30-4:15)

**[SCREEN: Switch to homepage or prepare slides with use cases]**

**YOU SAY:**
```
So who needs ClauseScan AI?

[Show icons or text on screen for each]

Freelancers - Before signing client contracts
Startups - Reviewing SaaS agreements  
Students - Checking internship contracts
Renters - Understanding lease agreements

The value is clear:

[Show statistics]
- Save 500 to 2,000 euros in legal consultation
- Avoid months of potential disputes
- Understand your rights before signing

One user told us: "ClauseScan found a clause that would have 
cost me 15,000 euros. I negotiated it out before signing."

That's real impact.
```

### 🎬 SECTION 7: TECHNOLOGY (4:15-4:45)

**[SCREEN: About page or tech showcase]**

**YOU SAY:**
```
Let's talk about the technology powering this.

ClauseScan uses cutting-edge AI:

[Point to each as you mention them]

Google Gemini 2.5 Flash - Our primary analysis engine
Legal-BERT - For legal language understanding

### 🎬 SECTION 8: GOING BEYOND (4:45-4:55)

**[SCREEN: Features page or keep on About]**

**YOU SAY:**
```
This project goes beyond basic AI applications.

We're not just calling an API - we're orchestrating multiple 
AI models, engineering custom prompts, and building a complete 
user experience around AI capabilities.

This demonstrates real-world AI application development - 
the same approach used by companies like GitHub, Notion, and Grammarly.
```
